## Description

The goal of this assignment is create an hour-by-hour calendar of the day that can be updated with tasks to complete throughout the day. The tasks are stored in local storage. The current day is displayed at the top, and the current hour-block is highlighted in red. Future hour-blocks are highlighted in green.

## Usage

This application can be used to list out and track tasks that need to be completed throghout the day.

## What I did

I built a JavaScript file to display the current day and time, and allow a user to input and save text into hour-by-hour blocks of time. The time blocks are generated through a JavaScript loop, using classes, tags, and a CSS file provided to me.

## What I learned

I learned about how day.js and moment.js can be used to track the current day and time. I learned how to store complex data types in local storage, as well as how jQuery can be used to traverse and retrieve information from the DOM.
